## 🧭 Project Structure

```
app/
└─ src/main/
   ├─ java/com/yourname/unscramble/
   │   ├─ MainActivity.kt       # Hosts the fragment
   │   ├─ GameFragment.kt       # UI & interaction logic
   │   └─ GameViewModel.kt      # Game state + logic
   └─ res/
       ├─ layout/               # XML files for activity & fragment
       └─ values/
           └─ strings.xml       # Scrambled words + UI text
build.gradle
```

**GameViewModel** manages:

* `LiveData` for scrambled word, score, and word count
* Methods: `submitGuess()`, `skipWord()`, `resetGame()`

---

## 🔧 Customization

* **Add Words**: Add to the word list in `strings.xml`.
* **Change Round Length**: Update `MAX_NO_OF_WORDS` in `GameViewModel`.
* **UI Tweaks**: Adjust colors, typography, or layouts as desired.
